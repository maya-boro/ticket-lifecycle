<p>
For users to submit a ticket, they will need to fill out a form (see below) where they will be required to provide their contact information and a description of the issue.

Once the form is submitted, they will be taken to a confirmation page (see below).

<p>
In the Agent Panel, support agents will be able to view and manage any tickets created by users in the support center.

<p>
After selecting a ticket, support agents can assign it, set its priority, post replies, add internal notes, and review the ticket thread for any changes made.Â

Changes in ticket assignment and priority will also be reflected in the agent panel dashboard.

<p>
Once a user issue has been resolved and the user has been notified, the ticket can be marked as resolved so it can be moved to the closed ticket section.
